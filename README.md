# Sorting_Hat

Readme for project details.

The Sorting Hat is a sentient hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to. These four Houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.

This project is an attempt to build something similar to that. It is a interactive chat bot that asks the user questions and sorts him/her in one of the four houses of Hogwarts depending upon the answers recieved. 

The Sorting Hat project has been build on the google's actions console using Dialogflow. Dialogflow is a natural language understanding platform used to design and integrate a conversational user interface into mobile apps, web applications, devices, bots, interactive voice response systems, and so on. The questions, that the sorting hat asks the user, were written in the text responses of intents and the probable answers, expected from the user, were alloted as the training phrases.

The agent is trained using the Dialogflow V1 API.

Some of the questions asked in the project have been taken from the sorting hat quiz on the Wizarding World website : https://www.wizardingworld.com. The rest of the questions have been made by me.

Due to inavailibility of backend services at the moment the project is on hold. As without a backend implementation it is not possible to implement the sorting algorithm. So, right now, the agent alots random houses to the users on completion of the questionnaire. Here's the link of the algorithm we wish to implement : https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/158222/how-does-the-pottermore-sorting-quiz-work.

Heres's the video link to see the functioning of the chat bot.

As it is a private project at the moment it can be run only on devices that are linked to a Google ID having access to the project. Drop a message with your email id if you want to run the bot on your device.
